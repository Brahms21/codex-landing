          CodeX is a group of software engineers looking to collaborate, learn
          and solve real world problems. We strive on the philosophy that each
          member's ideas will be heard and taken into consideration, and upon
          depolyment our projects will profit each member equally. As CodeX
          grows and members elevate their abilities, we will continue to push
          for larger projects and continue to solve larger problems. Solutions
          for X, as a variable X can mean many things, use any problem in your
          life as X. Through engineering we believe we can solve for X together.

          With four front-end developers able to handle design and UI, we are
          looking for back-end developers wanting to level up their skills. Node
          and Python are the preferred server side languages. We also need
          people to create and manage databases. This group is for you if want
          to work as a team and get away from solo developing. See what your
          small ideas can blossom into here. The only thing we require is time
          and effort.
